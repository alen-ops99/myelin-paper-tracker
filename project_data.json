      "content": "Looking at your current state, you need to build momentum quickly. Here's my strategic recommendation for this week:\n\n## Priority 1: Complete Figure 2 Foundation\n**Start with MAG quantification** - this is literally 30 minutes of ImageJ work and will complete your protein story. You already have the Western blot image, so just quantify it.\n\n**Then immediately cut IHC sections** - this unlocks ALL of Figure 3. Without sections, you can't do Olig2/CC1 or DegeneroTag staining.\n\n## Priority 2: Start Mass Spec Pipeline\n**Prepare and send samples to mass spec core** - this has the longest turnaround time (potentially 2-3 weeks), so get it in the queue NOW. The lipid data will be crucial for reviewers who want biochemical confirmation of your EM findings.\n\n## This Week's Action Plan:\n1. **Monday**: MAG quantification (30 min)\n2. **Monday-Tuesday**: Cut IHC sections from fixed tissue\n3. **Wednesday**: Prepare brain samples for mass spec\n4. **Thursday**: Send samples to mass spec core\n5. **Friday**: Start Olig2/CC1 IHC staining\n\n## Why This Sequence?\n- MAG quantification completes your protein panel (PLP\u2193, MAG\u2193, MBP unchanged = selective myelin protein loss)\n- IHC sections are the bottleneck for all cellular work\n- Mass spec needs to get in line early due to turnaround time\n- Starting Olig2/CC1 gives you weekend processing time\n\nThis approach puts you on track to have Figure 2 nearly complete and Figure 3 underway by next week. **Don't try to do everything - focus on removing bottlenecks.**\n\nWhat's your lab's typical mass spec turnaround time? This will affect our timeline strategy.",

      "content": "Excellent work! You've cleared all the major bottlenecks from Week 1. Let me analyze what this means for your timeline:\n\n## What You've Accomplished\nYou've essentially **unlocked the entire project pipeline**:\n- \u2705 MAG quantification \u2192 Figure 2 protein panel is now complete\n- \u2705 IHC sections cut \u2192 All of Figure 3 can now proceed\n- \u2705 Mass spec samples sent \u2192 Figure 2 lipid data is in the queue\n\n## Strategic Timeline Adjustments Needed\n\n```json:task_update\n{\n  \"action\": \"move_task\",\n  \"task_id\": \"western-blot-plp-recovery\",\n  \"new_week\": 2,\n  \"reason\": \"Recovery Western blots should start immediately since Figure 2 protein story is complete\"\n}\n```\n\n```json:task_update\n{\n  \"action\": \"move_task\", \n  \"task_id\": \"western-blot-mag-recovery\",\n  \"new_week\": 2,\n  \"reason\": \"Can run PLP and MAG recovery blots simultaneously\"\n}\n```\n\n## Week 2 Recommendation\n**Run both IHC AND recovery Western blots in parallel:**\n\n**Monday-Tuesday**: Start Olig2/CC1 IHC (3-day protocol)\n**Wednesday-Thursday**: Run recovery Western blots (PLP + MAG)\n**Friday**: Process IHC, start DegeneroTag prep\n\nThis parallel approach means:\n- Figure 3 cellular data starts flowing\n- Figure 4 recovery data gets completed early\n- You're not waiting around during IHC incubation steps\n\n**The key insight**: Since mass spec is out of your hands for 2-3 weeks, maximize your lab bench time by running experiments in parallel rather than sequentially.\n\nDoes your lab setup allow running Western blots while IHC sections are incubating? This parallel approach could accelerate your timeline significantly.",

      "content": "**WAIT - this is a major plot twist that changes everything!**\n\n## What This Means\nMAG **increasing** in sleep-deprived animals is the opposite of what we expected and completely reframes your story. This is actually **potentially more interesting** than a simple decrease.\n\n## New Narrative Implications\nInstead of \"sleep loss causes myelin protein loss,\" you now have:\n- **PLP decreases (~65%)** - structural myelin protein lost\n- **MAG increases** - adhesion/signaling protein accumulates  \n- **MBP unchanged** - basic myelin structure maintained\n\nThis suggests **myelin remodeling/dysfunction** rather than simple destruction!\n\n## Critical Next Steps - PRIORITIZE THESE:\n\n```json:task_update\n{\n  \"action\": \"add_task\",\n  \"task_id\": \"validate-mag-increase\",\n  \"new_week\": 2,\n  \"reason\": \"Must confirm this unexpected MAG increase with independent samples\"\n}\n```\n\n**1. Validate the MAG result immediately** - Run MAG Western on 2-3 more animals to confirm this isn't an artifact\n\n**2. Reframe recovery experiments** - The recovery Western blots are now CRITICAL. Does MAG stay high during recovery? This could explain why myelin doesn't restore.\n\n**3. Literature dive** - MAG accumulation might indicate failed myelin compaction or oligodendrocyte stress response\n\n## Research Questions This Opens\n- Is MAG accumulating because it can't properly localize?\n- Are oligodendrocytes trying to compensate for PLP loss?\n- Does this explain the myelin decompaction you see in EM?\n\n**This result could make your paper MORE impactful** - reviewers love unexpected findings that reveal new mechanisms. But you MUST validate it first.\n\nHow many animals was this MAG result from? We need to ensure statistical power before pivoting the story.",
